# Python Workshop 
### Step 1: Sign in on repl.it 
##### 1. Creat a new repl 
##### 2. select Python for the language and name the repl Python workshop 

### Step 2: Create a file called helloWorld.py
##### 1. To start our workshop we will simply print the phrase "hello world"
##### 2. To do this you must type "print()", and put hello world, in quatations, in the parenthesis
##### 3. After doing this just press run and see if it worked 

# variables 
### Creating String Variables 
##### Step 1: create a name for your variable
##### Step 2: assign the variable a string value, in this case we will assign it the value of "hello world"(Example: variable = "hello world")
##### Step 3: To use this variable simply just type print(variable), press run, and it should show hello world 
### Creating Number Variables 
##### Step 1: Just like for string variables you must come up with a variable name, the only difference is that you have to assign the variable a numerical value 
##### Example: number = 5
##### Step 2: To check to see if this works type print(number) and see if it prints 5 

# Basic Operations 
### Python allows the use of all basic operations, such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication
##### Step 1: Try typing in any calculation and then pressing run
##### You will see that it prints the correct value 

# Using mathematical operations with variables 
### Python also allows you to use numerical variables to perform basic mathematical operations 
##### Step 1: create two variables and assign them a numerical value 
##### Step 2: Then try to perform a operation with these variables 
###### Example: 
num1 = 7
num2 = 6
print(num1*num2)
##### This should print 42

# User Input with string values 
### User input allows you to assign variables with values that the user selects
### To use user input with string values you must type: 
#### variable = input("whats your name? ")
### This will put a message on the screen that says "Whats your name?" and then allows the user to type their name. It then then assigns the name to the variable. 
#### To print the name just type print(variable) 

# User input with integer values 
### Using user input with integer values will be very helpful when trying to make calculators 
### To do this you just have to type variable = int(input("enter a number: ")) and then print(num)
### This will ask the user to "enter a number" then will print that number

# If statements 
### if statements allow the computer to carry out certain commands if certain conditional statements are true 
### For example: 
#### variable = int(input("enter a number: "))
#### if variable < 7:
####    print(variable)
### This would print the value of variable if it is less than 7 

# Now try to create anything you want using python
### I reccomend starting with something like a calculator
